            <h3>Images are awesome.</h3>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my site to help teach about Media Formats. I have provided many examples on a few types of media commonly used around the internet. The one above this text is known as an SVG.</p>

            <h3>My favorite image type</h3>
            <p>You may have noticed that bell above the text. That is called an SVG, also known as Scalable Vector Graphics. SVGS Are important because they can be used to draw images without a tank on performance or strain on bandwith. Their file is literally just text being parsed to make up an image."</p>

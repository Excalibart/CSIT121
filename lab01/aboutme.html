            <p>
                Since this page will be public I will NOT be sharing anything that falls under PII(Personally Identifiable Information).
                Instead, I will be listing generic interests of mine. I like Videogames. I love my friends and family. And I love computers... most of the time (not now)

                I am very skilled with computers, enough for my friends to immediately contact me at the slightest inconveniece that windows bestows upon them. 
                As stated before, I like videogames my favorite Being Halo. I am currently getting into 3D printing. I have been selling small models to friends for short profit.

    <p id="BLOG-POST">Blog update. I have learned how CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to help with the visuals of my websites. Additionally, I also learned how to import images to my website. At the top of the header you will notie a small star. File is hosted on my github account. But more importantly I find CSS easier to use and I actually prefer writing it instead of regular HTML.</p>

    <p id="BLOG-POST">
      First Post. This is my HTML practice blog page. I absolutely hate writing HTML by hand. But it's a skill I'll need in the future. I do think it's very cool, though, getting a more thorough understanding of how websites work internally. Hopefully, I structured this website correctly.</p>

    <h1>Practice Blogpage</h1>
    <main>Written on 9/14/2025</main>
    <p>This is my HTML practice blog page. I absolutely hate writing HTML by hand. But it's a skill I'll need in the future. I do think it's very cool, though, getting a more thorough understanding of how websites work internally. Hopefully, I structured this website correctly.</p>

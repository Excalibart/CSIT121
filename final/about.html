            <img src="images/founder.jpg" alt="Our Beautiful Founder Fredrick Computerson who started it all!">
            <p>Started in 1970 by our founder Fredrick Computerson who spent his youth in a garage building and repairing electronics. Circuitworks grew from a one man dream to a multi million dollar engineering powerhouse you know today.</p>
            <p>Over the decades we upheld Fredrick's belief that no hardware will go to waste. Thats why we will stop at nothing to fix your hardware. No matter the size, no matter the challenge. If it has a circuit we'll make it work. </p>
            <p>Though we have had many partners over the years. Our mission would not be possible without the help of <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/english">TSMC</a> and <a href="https://www.ti.com/">Texas Instruments</a>.</p>
